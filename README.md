# MIXXCLOUD

MIXXCLOUD is a cloud environment project that integrates load balancing and auto-scaling using both IaaS and LBaaS models. The project is designed to provide high availability, fault tolerance, and security for modern cloud applications.

## Overview

The main goals of MIXXCLOUD are to:
- **Distribute traffic efficiently:** Implement load balancers that evenly distribute incoming requests to multiple server instances.
- **Ensure high availability:** Use techniques such as the Centralized Agents for Redundancy in Datacenter (CARD) to provide failover capabilities.
- **Support auto-scaling:** Integrate an interface to scale instances dynamically based on demand.
- **Provide multi-tenancy:** Allow tenants to create and manage Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), subnets, and instances.

## Project Objectives

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and LBaaS:** Offer two load balancing models within the same environment.
- **VPC & Subnet Management:** Enable tenants to create isolated networks with custom subnets and instances.
- **High Availability and Fault Tolerance:** Leverage redundant load balancers and health-check mechanisms to maintain service continuity.
- **Security:** Implement firewall rules, DDoS protection, and IP blacklisting to secure tenant applications.
- **Auditability:** Log API calls and system events for transparency and debugging.

## Architecture

MIXXCLOUD employs a layered architecture that includes:

- **VPCs and Subnets:** Isolated layer-3 networks with dedicated Linux bridges and VXLAN overlays for inter-host communication.
- **Load Balancers:** Two models are supported:
  - **IaaS Load Balancers:** Deployed on the VPC router and distribute traffic using iptables DNAT rules.
  - **LBaaS Load Balancers:** Run at the instance level within a subnet.
- **Auto-scaling Integration:** APIs allow auto-scalers to add or remove target IPs from the load balancer's pool.
- **CARD Mechanism:** A centralized agent monitors load balancer health and ensures that endpoint IPs are always assigned to active nodes.

### Sample iptables Rules

The following example shows how a load balancer distributes incoming traffic (from IP 10.10.10.2 on port 8080) to three backend instances using weighted DNAT rules:

```bash
sudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp -d 10.10.10.2 --dport 8080 \
  -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.33 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.106:80

sudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp -d 10.10.10.2 --dport 8080 \
  -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.5 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.103:80

sudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp -d 10.10.10.2 --dport 8080 \
  -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.102:80
```

*Explanation:*  
These rules show how traffic is probabilistically routed to different backend servers. The `--probability` flag helps balance load by directing roughly 33% of the traffic to one server, 50% to another, and the remaining traffic to a third server.

## API and CLI

MIXXCLOUD includes a CLI tool (built with Python and Click) that allows tenants to manage:

- **Tenants and VPCs:** Create, list, and delete VPCs.
- **Subnets and Instances:** Define subnets and launch containerized instances.
- **Load Balancers:** Configure load balancing rules, add or remove IPs from target groups, and view load balancer status.

### Infrastructure-in-One-File (I2OF)

The CLI also supports a YAML-based topology file to automate infrastructure creation. For example:

```yaml
Tenant_name: 
  VPC_name: 
    lb:  
      name: app 
      type: IAAS 
    subnets:  
      - name: S1 
        cidr: 192.168.45.0/24 
        servers: 
          - name: A1 
            image: zecaro/php-info 
            vcpu: 1 
            mem: 1024m 
            region: east 
            weight: 1 
          - name: A2 
            image: zecaro/php-info 
            vcpu: 1 
            mem: 1024m 
            region: east 
            weight: 1 
      - name: S2 
        cidr: 192.168.46.0/24 
        servers: 
          - name: A3 
            image: zecaro/php-info 
            vcpu: 1 
            mem: 1024m 
            region: east 
            weight: 1 
          - name: A4 
            image: zecaro/php-info 
            vcpu: 1 
            mem: 1024m 
            region: east 
            weight: 1 
```

*Explanation:*  
This YAML example defines a complete tenant infrastructure in a single file:

- **Tenant Level:**  
  The top-level key (here, "Tenant_name") represents the tenant.

- **VPC Definition:**  
  Under the tenant, "VPC_name" defines a Virtual Private Cloud that contains:
  - A load balancer (`lb`) named "app" using the IAAS model.
  - Multiple subnets.

- **Subnet S1:**  
  - **CIDR:** 192.168.45.0/24  
  - **Servers:**  
    - **A1 and A2:** Each server uses the "zecaro/php-info" image, has 1 vCPU, 1024 MB of memory, is deployed in the east region, and is assigned a weight of 1 for load balancing.

- **Subnet S2:**  
  - **CIDR:** 192.168.46.0/24  
  - **Servers:**  
    - **A3 and A4:** Configured similarly to servers A1 and A2.

Overall, this structure enables you to automatically create a tenantâ€™s environment with a VPC that includes a load balancer and two subnets, each hosting a set of servers. The weight values help determine how traffic is balanced across the servers in each subnet.

## Database and Logging

- **Database:** MIXXCLOUD uses MongoDB to store the state of all cloud entities (instances, subnets, VPCs, load balancers).
- **Audit Logs:** Every API call is logged to ensure accountability and traceability. For instance, API calls for tenant operations are recorded in log files such as `JK_api_log.log`.
